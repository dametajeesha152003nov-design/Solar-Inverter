# Solar-Inverter
This project demonstrates a basic low-power solar inverter system designed to convert DC power from a solar energy source into usable AC output for small loads.  The system consists of a solar panel, solar charge controller, battery storage, and an inverter stage using a transistor switch and a step-down transformer.
