# Solar-Inverter
This project demonstrates a basic low-power solar inverter system designed to convert DC power from a solar energy source into usable AC output for small loads.  The system consists of a solar panel, solar charge controller, battery storage, and an inverter stage using a transistor switch and a step-down transformer.


Working of solar inverter :
Solar panels are usually made from silicon, which provides a semi-conductor surface. The panels sit within a metal frame encased in glass. When particles of light – photons – hit the silicon of each individual solar panel, electrons become agitated. This creates a photovoltaic (PV) charge, which in turn produces an electrical direct current (DC). The panel’s wiring captures this current, and it’s the solar inverter that converts the DC to an alternating current (AC). Solar inverters connect the solar panel system to the existing electrical meter, or it feeds the power to the electrical grid
